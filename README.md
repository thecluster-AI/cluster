> Distributed intelligence through cluster computation 

cluster is a decentralized AI system powered by four interconnected cluster models, delivering emergent behavior through collective computation. Like a cluster mind, each model functions as a specialized node, processing and sharing information across the network.

## Core Components

### Particle System Engine
- Real-time particle simulation with dynamic behavior patterns
- State management and physics-based interactions
- Performance-optimized computation

### Cluster Controllers
Four specialized behavior models:

1. **Neural Network Model**
   - Grid-based particle organization
   - Dynamic synaptic connections
   - Collective pattern formation

2. **Quantum Field Model**
   - Quantum-inspired probabilistic transitions
   - Entanglement-like particle interactions
   - Wave function collapse simulation

3. **Cosmic Dust Model**
   - Gravitational field simulation
   - Orbital dynamics and trajectories
   - Harmonic oscillation patterns

4. **Fireflies Model**
   - Bio-inspired synchronization
   - Phase coupling between particles
   - Emergent global patterns

## System Architecture

```typescript
interface ClusterArchitecture {
  particleSystem: {
    state: ParticleState[];
    behavior: ClusterBehavior;
    physics: PhysicsEngine;
  };
  
  neuralNetwork: {
    nodes: NeuralNode[];
    connections: Connection[];
    learningRate: number;
  };
  
  visualization: {
    renderer: WebGLRenderer;
    camera: Camera;
    scene: Scene;
  };
}
```

## Implementation

### Particle System Configuration

```typescript
interface ClusterConfig {
  particleCount: number;
  particleSpeed: number;
  connectionDistance: number;
  targetForce: number;
  maxSpeed: number;
  friction: number;
  repulsion: number;
  behavior: ClusterBehavior;
}
```

### Core Mechanics

- Real-time state management
- Physics-based interactions
- Dynamic behavior patterns
- Pattern recognition
- Adaptive learning
- State synchronization

## Advanced Features

### Emergent Behavior Analysis
```
Complexity = -Σ pᵢlog(pᵢ)  // Information Entropy
ψ = 1/N |Σexp(iθⱼ)|      // Global Synchronization
C(r) = ⟨v(x)·v(x+r)⟩     // Spatial Correlation
```

### Visualization Layer
- Interactive real-time rendering
- State monitoring
- Dynamic connection visualization
- Performance metrics
